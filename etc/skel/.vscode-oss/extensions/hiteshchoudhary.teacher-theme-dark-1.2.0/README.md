# Teacher Theme
## Dark edition

Hi, my name is Hitesh and I make a lot of videos where I teach programming. Teaching programming comes with many challenges and one of them is to make sure that user is able to see the code properly. Contrast in functions, variables, active tab, these are just some challenges to go through.

This theme came out from these minor changes that I did over the years to make sure code is visible and look good on screen. 

> Not too bright and not too subtle.

The update situation is little tricky. I will surely push some minor tweeks or the time but depends on free time.
